# ✅ **Break System Logic Updated: 3 Consecutive Failures**

## 🔄 **Changes Made:**

### **📊 Database Schema Update:**
- **`user_break_status` table** now tracks:
  - `consecutive_failures` (instead of `games_in_session`)
  - `last_game_result` ('win' or 'fail')
  - Same break timing logic

### **🎯 New Break Logic:**
**Before:** 15-minute break after playing 3 games in 15 minutes  
**After:** 15-minute break only after failing 3 games in a row

### **🔧 Updated Functions:**

#### **1. `checkGlobalBreakStatus()`**
- Now returns `consecutiveFailures` instead of `gamesInSession`
- Checks for consecutive failures instead of games played
- Maintains same break timing and expiration logic

#### **2. `recordGameOutcome(userId, gameResult)`**
- **New function** replaces `updateGlobalBreakStatus()`
- Tracks consecutive failures when `gameResult === 'fail'`
- **Resets consecutive failures to 0** when `gameResult === 'win'`
- Triggers 15-minute break when `consecutiveFailures >= 3`

#### **3. Game Completion Updates:**
- **Wins:** Call `recordGameOutcome(userId, 'win')` → resets failure counter
- **Losses:** Call `recordGameOutcome(userId, 'fail')` → increments failure counter

### **📱 User Interface Updates:**

#### **Break Timer Modal:**
- **Message:** "You've failed **X** games in a row" (instead of games played)
- **Same countdown display:** MM:SS format
- **Same visual styling:** Animated clock icon, gradient background

#### **Break Notifications:**
- **Failure Alert:** "You've failed X games in a row. Take a 15-minute break!"
- **Win Reset:** Consecutive failures reset to 0 on any win

### **🎮 Gameplay Impact:**

#### **Positive Reinforcement:**
- **Wins reset the counter** → encourages continued play after success
- **Only failures count** → no penalty for successful gameplay
- **Fair break system** → rewards skill, not just activity

#### **Break Conditions:**
- **Trigger:** 3 consecutive game failures (timeouts or wrong matches)
- **Duration:** 15 minutes from failure #3
- **Reset:** Any win resets consecutive failure counter to 0
- **Scope:** Applies across all levels (global break)

### **📊 Example Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: Skilled Player**
```
Game 1: Win → Failures: 0
Game 2: Win → Failures: 0  
Game 3: Win → Failures: 0
Game 4: Win → Failures: 0
Result: No breaks, continuous play encouraged
```

#### **Scenario 2: Struggling Player**
```
Game 1: Fail → Failures: 1
Game 2: Fail → Failures: 2
Game 3: Fail → Failures: 3 → 15-min break triggered
Game 4: (after break) Fail → Failures: 1
Result: Break gives time to rest/improve
```

#### **Scenario 3: Mixed Performance**
```
Game 1: Fail → Failures: 1
Game 2: Win → Failures: 0 (reset!)
Game 3: Fail → Failures: 1
Game 4: Fail → Failures: 2
Game 5: Win → Failures: 0 (reset!)
Result: Wins provide "get out of break free" cards
```

### **🛡️ Technical Benefits:**

✅ **Fairer System:** Rewards skill over persistence  
✅ **Better UX:** No breaks for successful players  
✅ **Encourages Learning:** Gives struggling players time to improve  
✅ **Maintains Balance:** Still prevents excessive play after failures  
✅ **Database Efficient:** Same table structure, updated logic  

### **🎯 Key Behavioral Changes:**

1. **Wins = Freedom:** Any successful game resets the failure counter
2. **Failures Accumulate:** Only consecutive losses trigger breaks  
3. **Strategic Play:** Players can "reset" their break timer by winning
4. **Learning Opportunity:** Break time can be used to study/learn the game

## ✅ **Status: Complete**

The break system now provides a more fair and skill-based approach, where only consecutive failures trigger mandatory breaks, while successful gameplay keeps players engaged without interruption.
